# 🐍 Hash Finder, Cracker, and ASCII Art Generator 🎨

Welcome to the **Hash Finder**, **Hash Cracker**, and **ASCII Art Generator** project! This repository contains three Python scripts that provide functionalities for hashing strings, cracking hashes, and generating ASCII art. Below is a brief overview of each script. 

---

## 🛠️ Files Included

### 1. **hash_finder.py** 🔍
This script allows users to generate SHA-1 and MD5 hashes from input strings. It also saves the generated hashes to a file named `hash_output.txt`.

#### Key Features:
- Choose between SHA-1 and MD5 hash generation
- User-friendly command line interface
- Saves results to `hash_output.txt` 📁

#### Example Usage:
```bash
python hash_finder.py
```
🌟 **Output:** Displays the hash value for the input string.

---

### 2. **cracker.py** 🔓
This script helps users crack SHA-1 and MD5 hashes by comparing them against a list of potential passwords stored in `file.txt`. 

#### Key Features:
- Supports cracking both SHA-1 and MD5 hashes
- Displays attempts and results on the console
- Reports whether the password was found or not

#### Example Usage:
```bash
python cracker.py
```
🔑 **Output:** The program will indicate if the password is found or not.

---

### 3. **ascii_creator.py** ✨
This script generates ASCII art from user-defined messages. Users can choose from multiple fonts to create unique text designs, which are then saved to `ascii_art_output.txt`.

#### Key Features:
- Choose from various ASCII art fonts
- Custom messages for generating art
- Saves ASCII art to `ascii_art_output.txt` 📖

#### Example Usage:
```bash
python ascii_creator.py
```
🖼️ **Output:** Displays and saves the ASCII art based on user input.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use the scripts, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You may also need to install the `colorama` and `pyfiglet` packages for color support and ASCII art generation:

```bash
pip install colorama pyfiglet
```

### 🧑‍💻 Running the Scripts
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Password_Cracker.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
   cd Password_Cracker
   ```
3. Run any of the scripts as needed:
   ```bash
   python hash_finder.py
   python cracker.py
   python ascii_creator.py
   ```
